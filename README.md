# resin-icinga
Uses the resin CLI to check if a node is online

## Installation

```
sudo apt instal npm nodejs-legacy
sudo npm install resin-cli -g
```


Once the CLI is installed it will need to be logged into the resin system to access devices.  This can be done by running resin login (as the user that will be peforming the checks) and following the onscreen instructions.
